# **Sunscreen Pricing Strategies on Tokopedia (July 2025): Skintific vs Somethinc**

## Project Background
In a highly competitive skincare market, sunscreen is one of the most competitive products because it is one of the must-have products to protect the skin from UV radiation. Around 51% of people in Indonesia use sunscreen due to the increase in weather temperature, and the number will keep increasing with the amount of awareness on how important it is to use sunscreen. With a progressive increase in awareness of the need to use sunscreen, the Indonesian sunscreen market will experience growth in the future. A lot of brands have their own Sunscreen such as Skintific and Somethinc. It is interesting to see how two of them are part of the top beauty brands in Indonesia on selling their products and competing with each other.

## Objectives
This project aims to analyse how skincare brands determine the pricing of their sunscreen products in a highly dynamic and competitive market. The analysis will focus on discount effectiveness, target audience, price range, and brand positioning. Through this approach, we aim to uncover how each brand positions itself, uncover its pricing strategies, how their competes, and give valuable insights for marketers and professionals in the beauty industry.

## Conclusion
Skintific and Somethinc have different brand awareness strategies. Skintific market themselves as "healthy skincare", while Somethinc always campaigns "Be you, Be Somethinc", which encourages you to be the best of yourself. Both brands receive positive reviews from customers based on product ratings on Tokopedia. Skintific and Somethinc have the same market, but the difference is that Skintific customers are willing to pay more for the premium price and have more sold products than Somethinc. It is caused by their brand awareness as a "healthy skincare" brand. It means that most customers are more interested in the brands that make their skin healthier. It is making Skintific adopt a value-based pricing model, and Somethinc is leaning more towards using a competition-based pricing model to compete with Skintific and other skincare products. It shows how brand awareness can influence the pricing model of a brand. 

We can also see how important it is to adapt the pricing model. In the case of July 2025, Skintific is giving many discounts on their sunscreen products to push their sales volume to improve profit margin, which can be a stock clearance strategy. Their average sunscreen price is even lower than the average price of Somethinc sunscreen products. This is a common practice, as we know that FMCG industries are characterised by having lower profit margins and high sales volume.

## Recommendations
As a data analyst and marketers in beauty industries, here's we can do to improve our skincare business and optimizing pricing strategy:
- Optimising business using competition-based pricing, by adapting brand awareness to include product safety, also promoting healthy skin. This can make the products stand out more and build loyalty through trust. Current markets value products that promote healthy skin.
- Use value-based pricing only if the products have a lot of loyal customers compared to others.
- Don't get stuck in one pricing strategy; use a dynamic pricing strategy based on the current market and brand images.
- Customer-perceived value is important to determine pricing strategy. Using KOLs that promote healthy skin can improve the customer perceived value in the current markets.
- Customer loyalty is also an important factor when determining a pricing strategy. Strengthening the emotional connection with customers can be achieved by creating educational content, not only on how to use skincare products properly, but also on topics such as healthy skin, overall wellness, and transparent product safety information.
